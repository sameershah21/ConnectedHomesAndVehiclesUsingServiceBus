# ConnectedHomesAndVehiclesUsingServiceBus
Created on Microsoft Azure Service Bus Architecture, using Topics and Subscriptions, this application is a messaging system which connects multiple homes and multiple vehicles effectively and securely. Messages and data are transferred on the Azure's MaaS platform. This is just a conceptual setup as of now, but I will add Raspberry Pi's output as an input to this application so that it can process real data in later releases. Messages that convey temperature of a home or vehicle of the user or user's family members and detect burglary of the house or vehicle have been added as principle functionality to this cloud based application.
